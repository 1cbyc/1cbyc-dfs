# download-websites

It's not legal to download websites though. You need permission from the site owner to do so.

That said, I intend to use cURL library to start the base version of this script.

This is how this script would work:
* First, the script requires you to entire the URL of the website you want to download.
* Next, you initialize the cURL, set options for the cURL, and then execute requests
* Once that's done, the script does a check for errors, close the cURL session and then save response to your choice file.
